# MinimumSpanningTree

tags: C++,C, Boruvska, Kruskal, Prim, MPI, Knn and others Clustering methods

In this project we study minimum spanning trees though Prim, Boruvska and Kruskal's Algorithms.

Also we present a Parallel version of Prim's Algorithm using MPI(Messsage Passing Interface).

And apply MST in a clustering method, comparing him with the K-NearestNeighbors method, also implemented.
